IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

A professional data analysis capstone project inspired by the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate.
This project demonstrates skills in data collection, wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visualization, dashboard creation, and storytelling insights.

📊 Dataset

The project uses multiple datasets collected from various sources including:

Job postings and APIs – for analyzing in-demand programming skills.

Survey data – for understanding industry trends and compensation.

Web scraping – for gathering structured and unstructured data.

🔍 Project Workflow
